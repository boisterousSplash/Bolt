## Usage

Users can find running partners with a click of a button. The app will find a random place for the user to run and give them a goal time for them to try for. If the user wants added incentive, the app will find her a running partner nearby and start them both off in a race towards a common finish line.

## Requirements

- Node 3.5.3+
- MongoDB 3.2.3+

## Development
